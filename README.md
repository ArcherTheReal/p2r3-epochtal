# Epochtal Tournament System
Framework for autonomous management of Portal 2 tournaments.

Reaching for the ambitious goal of bringing Portal 2 as close to a competitive esport as possible, starting by building a solid technical foundation. Intended for use in [epochtal.p2r3.com](https://epochtal.p2r3.com/), designed for adaptability in any Portal 2 tournament context.

## Setup
This project is written for the [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/), and will not work on other runtimes such as Node or Deno.

To set it up, install the dependencies and run the entrypoint file:
```bash
bun install
